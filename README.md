It was developed with C++ and has strong Object Oriented Programming aspects. <br>
It runs in console, it presents weather data for countries in Europe. It uses a database of weather statistics since 1980 to create candlesticks for each year, for each country. <br>
You are able to filter the weather data by country and by years. You are also able to predict the weather for one year ahead. <br>

It does include some OOP aspects. <br>
It was developed using p5.js, alongside ML5.js for machine learning face and hands detection. It runs in a browser and was developed to use as little resources as possible, only manipulating the pixel array when necessary. <br>
